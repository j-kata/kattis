# FizzBuzz

Print the integers from 1 to `N`, replacing any of them divisible by `X` with `Fizz` or, divisible by `Y`, with `Buzz`. If the number is divisible by both `X` and `Y`, print `FizzBuzz` instead.

## Input

Three integers on a single line, `X`, `Y` and `N` (`1 <= X < Y <= N <= 100`).

## Output

Print integers from `1` to `N` in order, each on its own line, replacing the ones divisible by `X` with `Fizz`, the ones divisible by `Y` with `Buzz` and ones divisible by both `X` and `Y` with `FizzBuzz`.

## Example

Sample Input

```
