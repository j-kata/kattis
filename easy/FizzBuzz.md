# FizzBuzz

Print the integers from 1 to _N_, replacing any of them divisible by _X_ with **Fizz** or, divisible by _Y_, with **Buzz**. If the number is divisible by both _X_ and _Y_, print **FizzBuzz** instead.

## Input

Three integers on a single line, _X_, _Y_ and _N_ (1 <= _X_ < _Y_ <= _N_ <= 100).

## Output

Print integers from 1 to _N_ in order, each on its own line, replacing the ones divisible by _X_ with **Fizz**, the ones divisible by _Y_ with **Buzz** and ones divisible by both _X_ and _Y_ with **FizzBuzz**.
