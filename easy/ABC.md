# ABC

You will be given three integers `A`, `B` and `C`. The numbers will not be given in that exact order, but we do know that `A` is less than `B` and `B` is less than `C`. Rearrange them in a given order.

## Input

**First line**: Three positive integers, each on of them will be less than or equal to `100`.

**Second line**: Three uppecase letters `A`, `B` and `C` (with no spaces between them) representing the desired order.

## Output

Output numbers `A`, `B` and `C` in the desired order on a single line, separated by single spaces.
