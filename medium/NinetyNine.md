# Ninety-nine

Write a program that always wins a game.

Rules of the game:

You start, by saying either the number `1` or `2`. You then take turns, starting with your friend, increasing this number by either `1` or `2` in each step. The first player who gets to say the number `99` wins.

## Interactivity

This problem is interactive. You should start by prining either `1` or `2` on a single line.
The grader will then read this number (`x`), and in return print a line with either
`x + 1` or `x + 2`, which can be read by your program. Your program should then print a number which is `1` or `2` higher, and so on.
