# Ninety-nine

Rules of the game:

You start, by saying either the number 1 or 2. You then take turns, starting with your friend, increasing this number by either 1 or 2 in each step. The first player who gets to say the number 99 wins.

## Interactivity

This problem is interactive. You should start by prining either 1 or 2 on a single line.
The grader will then read this number (_x_), and in return print a line with either
_x_ + 1 or _x_ + 2, which can be read by your program. Your program should then print a number which is 1 or 2 higher, and so on.
